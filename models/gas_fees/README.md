# Time Series Model

This repository contains a time series model that is designed to analyze and predict patterns in sequential data. The model utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to capture temporal dependencies and make accurate forecasts.

## Features

-  **Data Preprocessing**: The model includes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and seasonality in the time series data.
-  **Model Architecture**: The architecture of the model is based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are well-suited for capturing sequential patterns.
-  **Training**: The model is trained using historical time series data and optimized using appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.
-  **Forecasting**: Once trained, the model can be used to generate future predictions based on new input data.
-  **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using relevant metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

## Getting Started

To use the time series model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Prepare your time series data by organizing it in a suitable format.
3. Preprocess the data using the provided preprocessing script or your own custom preprocessing techniques.
4. Train the model using the training script, adjusting hyperparameters as necessary.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions on new time series data.

## Example Usage

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from time_series_model import TimeSeriesModel

# Load and preprocess the time series data
data = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv')
preprocessed_data = preprocess(data)

# Train the time series model
model = TimeSeriesModel()
model.train(preprocessed_data)

# Evaluate the model's performance
metrics = model.evaluate(preprocessed_data)

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = pd.read_csv('new_time_series_data.csv')
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```
